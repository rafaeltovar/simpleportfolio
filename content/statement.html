      <h1>Occupied spaces</h1>
      
      <p>A squat is a space that allows collectives and groups to come together and live autonomously, independent of institutions. It works as an assembly and allows people to design their own lives, on both a personal and communal level, under their own conditions and not those imposed by neoliberal politics.</p>

      <p>These photos show a small set of occupied spaces. These photos want to show the collective construction of spaces to live, meet and create. Spaces very different from each other but with a common axis: Occupied spaces.</p>

      <p>These pictures were taken in Cordoba, Malaga and Madrid (Spain) in 2011.</p>
